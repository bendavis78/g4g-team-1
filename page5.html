    <p>Cyberbullying is bullying on the internet and social 
    media. Sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn
    are the perfect places for cyberbullying. It's very similar to 
    verbal bullying in the sense that, instead of the bully saying something, 
    they're posting it on social media. Rude texts, photos, messages, 
    emails, comments, and posts are all forms of cyberbullying. It is one
    of the leading causes of depression and suicide among teenagers. It can
    happen to ANYONE. If you're being bullied, or you are a bully,
